This is a simple library of parser combinators for Javascript based on
Packrat parsers [1] and Parsing expression grammars [2].

[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar

The only documentation currently available in this blog entry:

http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2007/10/javascript-parser-combinators.html

An example of usage is in example1.js, containing some of the
Ecmascript grammar, and in the tests.js file.

I use it from within the Mozilla Rhino environment but it also works
in the browser.
