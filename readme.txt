This is a simple library of parser combinators for Javascript. It is a
mix of ideas from various parser combinator libraries written in other
languages (Haskell, Clean, C++). 

The only documentation currently available in this blog entry:

http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2007/10/javascript-parser-combinators.html

An example of usage is in example1.js, containing some of the
Ecmascript grammar, and in the tests.js file.

I use it from within the Mozilla Rhino environment but it also works
in the browser.
